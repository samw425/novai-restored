# NEXA INTELLIGENCE: MASTER STRATEGIC PLAN
**"The Daily Terminal for Modern A&R"**

## 1. The Core Philosophy: Why They Visit Daily
**The Problem**: Current tools (Spotify Charts, Kworb) are static or backward-looking. A&Rs fear missing "the moment" an artist breaks.
**The Solution**: SoundScout (NEXA) is the *Bloomberg Terminal for Music*. It is dynamic, predictive, and visual.
**The Hook**: "Who popped off *last night*?"

### The Daily Loop (Retention Strategy)
1.  **Morning Briefing**: The "Up & Comers" and "Arbitrage" lists refresh every 24h. An A&R visits to verify they haven't missed a breakout.
2.  **Visual Validation**: They don't just read names; they click the **Quick Play Avatar** to instantly hear the sound and see the look.
3.  **Deep Diligence**: They open the **Intelligence Dossier** to see if the numbers match the hype (Revenue, Churn, Contract Status).

## 2. The "NEXA" Aesthetic & Experience
**Visual Language**:
*   **Dark Mode Terminal**: High contrast (Slate-950 background), neon accents (Cyber-Cyan, Signal-Green).
*   **Identity First**: No plain text lists. Every artist has a high-quality visual anchor (Avatar/Grid).
*   **Interactive Utility**: The UI is fast.
    *   *Click Image* → **Quick Play** (Instant YouTube/SoundCloud check).
    *   *Click Name* → **Open Profile** (Deep Dive).
    *   *Hover* → **Micro-Data** (Gain/Loss % glows).

## 3. Product Roadmap: The 4 Pillars

### Pillar A: The Living Dashboard (Done/Refining)
*   **Power Index**: The global leaderboard.
*   **Signal Filters**: One-click filters for "Viral Now", "Label Bidding", "Undervalued".
*   **Visual Table**: The interactive table we just built (Image = Play).

### Pillar B: The "Full" Profile (The Current Focus)
A generic profile is not enough. A "Full" profile needs to answer 5 questions in 5 seconds:
1.  **The Sound**: Top track player embedded.
2.  **The Look**: The "Visual Intelligence" grid (Instagram/TikTok aesthetic check).
3.  **The Numbers**: Cross-platform growth (Spotify vs TikTok conversion).
4.  **The Status**: "Signed", "Independent", or "Distro-Deal" (Predicted).
5.  **The Reach**: Verified contact info or manager details (Mocked for now, but structurally ready).

### Pillar C: The "Scout" Workspace (New)
*   **Watchlist**: Save artists to a private roster.
*   **Compare Tool**: "Artist A vs Artist B" growth rendering.
*   **Notes**: Private text field on profiles for A&R notes ("Saw at showcase, good vocals").

### Pillar D: The "Alpha" Feed (New)
*   A scrolling news ticker or "Live Activity" feed showing real-time movements: *"Artist X just crossed 100k TikTok followers"*, *"Artist Y gained 50% monthly listeners today."*

## 4. Execution Strategy
We work **Local First**.
1.  **Iterate Profiles**: Expand the Dossier into a full-screen, data-rich experience.
2.  **Build "Alpha" Feed**: Create the daily hook (the "What happened overnight" ticker).
3.  **Data Depth**: Enhance the mock data to include "Contract Status" and "Manager Contact" fields.
4.  **Deploy**: Only when we have verified the *daily loop* feels addictive.
5.  **Data Validity (CRITICAL)**: Replace hardcoded multipliers with justified, transparent models (Revenue = Stream Count * Market Rate, Valuation = Revenue * Standard Multiple). No fake info.
