# Novai Intelligence - Session Notes
## December 13, 2025 - End of Day Summary

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Deploy Earnings Hub page to usenovai.live

---

## ✅ WHAT'S COMPLETE

### Earnings Hub Features Built:
- **Live Wire Feed**: 35+ companies with earnings headlines, sentiment badges, 8-K/IR/Webcast links
- **Upcoming Earnings Calendar**: Real dates (Banks Jan 15, Tech Jan 28-30, NVDA Feb 26)
- **Search**: 100+ S&P 500 & NASDAQ tickers with typeahead
- **Company Details Panel**: Slide-over with next earnings, past quarters, external links
- **Sidebar Link**: Added to INTELLIGENCE section with green highlight
- **Tabs**: SCANNER/SIGNALS/FILINGS and ALL/AI-TECH/TODAY filters

### Technical Status:
- ✅ Build passes locally (`npm run build` succeeds)
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Saved with tag: `earnings-hub-ready-2025-12-13`

---

## ❌ BLOCKER

### Vercel Deployment Issue
- Primary Vercel account is **MAXED OUT** on deployments
- Second Vercel account exists but not connected/working
- Result: Pushes to GitHub don't trigger deployments
- Page shows 404 on production despite code being ready

---

## ⚠️ CONCERNS RAISED

1. **Globe appearing black on localhost** - may not affect production but needs verification
2. **Live ticker showing fallback text on localhost** - RSS feeds failing locally but works on production
3. **Risk of affecting existing pages** - User wants surgical addition, not full merge

---

## 📋 TOMORROW'S PLAN

### Step 1: Verify Production State
- Check what's actually live on usenovai.live right now
- Compare to local codebase
- Identify the exact commit that matches production

### Step 2: Resolve Vercel Blocker
- Get second Vercel account connected
- OR check if primary account limits have reset
- Verify deployment pipeline is working

### Step 3: Clean Deployment Approach
- Start from PRODUCTION state (not current local)
- Add ONLY earnings-related files:
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/earnings/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/api/earnings/*` (all routes)
  - `src/lib/earnings/*` (types, cache, providers)
  - `src/components/earnings/*` (components)
  - `src/app/actions/earnings.ts`
  - Sidebar link in `src/components/navigation/Sidebar.tsx`
- Do NOT touch: Globe, NewsTicker, or any other existing pages

### Step 4: Pre-Deploy Checklist
```bash
npm run build     # MUST pass
npm run lint      # Fix errors
git diff --stat   # Review changes
```

### Step 5: Deploy & Verify
- Push to GitHub
- Monitor Vercel build
- Test on production
- Verify no regressions on other pages
